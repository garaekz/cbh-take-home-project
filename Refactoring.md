# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

I've refactored the code by breaking down the logic into smaller, more manageable functions that are easier to understand. Each function has a descriptive name that reflects what it does and performs an specific task, making the code much more readable. Additionally, by breaking down the code into smaller functions, it becomes easier to write and maintain unit tests for each part of the code. I've also used modern JavaScript syntax and practices, making the code easier to understand for developers who are familiar with these conventions.
